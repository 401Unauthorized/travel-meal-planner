## üíæ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/401Unauthorized/travel-meal-planner.git
cd travel-meal-planner
npm install
```


## üîå Quick Start

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of the project and add the following:

```BASH
YELP_KEY=abc123
```
> Note, the YELP_KEY is your private API key provided on the Yelp Developer platform.

Run the development server using the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

> Note, a script runs in the background to create a local MongoDB server which stores data in memory to be used by the application server during development. The DB server will automatically be stopped when the application is stopped.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the web page.

## üîÆ Features

This is a full-stack `Next.js` application which uses `React` on the frontend and `Node.js` / `Express` on the backend.

All the code is within the `src` directory.

### Frontend Directories
- components
- pages
- styles

### Backend Directories
- backend
- pages/api/...

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) are accessed on the [http://localhost:3000/api/](http://localhost:3000/api/) path.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of `React` components/pages.

For production, [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) become serverless functions using a `Node.js` runtime and can be deployed to numerous cloud providers.


## üëì Transparency
- There are very simplified or missing data validation for the API, DB & feature code.
- Due to time constraints, test cases are limited (YelpRestaurants.test.js is the most complete)
- Security considerations have not been implemented (rate limiting, etc)
- This has not been deployed / used in a production environment
